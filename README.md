## Setup

Include two `.xcconfig` files in the `Configuration` folder for proper compiling, these files should be named `Debug.xcconfig` and `Release.xcconfig` respectively. Both files must contain this:
```
API_KEY = <some_api_key>
```
Remember to replace placeholders with the required values (including 'greater than' and 'less than' symbols).
